Azure icon
==========

I had to do a presentation, and I was unable to find an icon for Windows Azure,
so I extracted one from the web page and hacked it a little.

Extracted from http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/what-is-azure/.

I have improved it, not just to have the logo but also the text of the service
as it appears in the web page.

License
-------

I have no idea which license should this have, but I suppose it's Microsoft's.
Moreover, they are using Microsoft Sans Serif Regular for the font, so I used
the same
